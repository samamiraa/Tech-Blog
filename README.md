# Tech-Blog

LIVE URL üëáüèº<br>

## Description

A tech blog that uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL. This project was a bit of a challenge for me. There was mostly a lot of debugging and getting the frontend to successfully communicate with the backend. This is certainly not a perfect application, there are a few things I would add to the future development of the project. I would adjust the styling a bit further to make it a bit more responsive. Of course bootstrap has some built in. My main focus was functionality. I was motivated to have the user successfully modify the database by adding, updating and deleting data.
